**HISTORY OF 3D PRINTING**

The history of 3D printing began in 1981 with Dr. Hideo Kodama's invention of a rapid prototyping machine using UV-polymerized resin. Chuck Hull, credited as the "inventor of 3D printing," filed the first patent for stereolithography (SLA) in 1986, introducing the .stl file format commonly used in 3D printing. In 1988, Carl Deckard licensed selective laser sintering (SLS), and in 1989, Scott Crump patented fused deposition modelling (FDM), founding Stratasys. These milestones marked the emergence of various 3D printing technologies, laying the foundation for the industry's growth.

In the 1990s, the early 3D printing industry experienced significant growth, marked by the founding of new companies and the exploration of various additive manufacturing technologies. A noteworthy development occurred in 2006 when the first commercially available selective laser sintering (SLS) printer was introduced, indicating a milestone in the industry's evolution.

**3D Printers today**

Since the advent of commercial 3D printers, the industry has undergone significant changes. Now, 3D printers are widely used in diverse sectors like aerospace, architecture, manufacturing, automotive, healthcare, and construction.

Scientists from [Florida Atlantic University](http://www.fau.edu/) (FAU) and the [US Office of Naval Research](https://www.onr.navy.mil/) have designed and created 3D printed soft robot jellyfish capable of monitoring fragile coral reefs.

SOFT ROBOTS HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO EXPLORE AND MONITOR DELICATE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS LIKE CORAL REEFS WITHOUT CAUSING UNINTENTIONAL DAMAGE TO FRAGILE OBJECTS.

The jellyfish robot navigating through the ocean.

According to Dr. Erik Engeberg, Associate Professor at the Department of Ocean and Mechanical Engineering, FAU, the study of fragile aquatic environments has always been challenging for marine researchers. Coral reefs, in particular, are important to monitor as they provide habitats and shelter for various marine organisms.

Thus, the team of researchers, recognizing the excellent swimming capabilities of the jellyfish, have developed five unique soft robots capable of maneuvering “untethered in the ocean, squeezing through orifices more narrow than the nominal diameter of the jellyfish, and steering from side to side.”

The jellyfish robots maintain a 3D printed body with eight soft hydraulic network actuators extending from the center, similar to the form of a moon jellyfish. These actuators were chosen to minimize inadvertent damage to fragile biological systems. The study explains, “live jellyfish essentially have neutral buoyancy, so water was chosen as the medium to inflate the hydraulic network actuators while freely swimming in the ocean, pool, or aquarium.”

The researchers designed mold models for the jellyfish robot in [SolidWorks ](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/took-solidworks-training-course-solid-solutions-132740/)and subsequently 3D printed with an Ultimaker 2 using PLA. “Each tentacle had a common channel extending radially outward from the center of the robot; four of these channels were connected on each side of the jellyfish so that four tentacles could be driven by a single impeller pump,” the study states.  Furthermore, two pumps were used to actuate the eight tentacles.

The tentacle actuators and segmented flap molds which made the body of the jellyfish robot was then filled with silicon rubber. A cylindrical housing for the jellyfish microcontroller and electronics was also 3D printed out with ABS using an [Axiom AirWolf](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/airwolf-3ds-axiom-3d-printer-gets-a-dual-head-upgrade-65612/) 3D printer.

Dr. Engeberg added: “We found the robots were able to swim through openings narrower than the nominal diameter of the robot. In the future, we plan to incorporate environmental sensors like sonar into the robot’s control algorithm, along with a navigational algorithm. This will enable it to find gaps and determine if it can swim through them.”

Their [**findings**](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/aadcb3/meta) were published in the journal Bioinspiration and Biomimetics.

**Theory on GCODE**

**1. Basic Syntax:**

- G-code commands consist of letters and numbers.
- Letters represent different actions, such as movement or tool changes.
- Numbers provide parameters for those actions.
- For example, G00 is a rapid positioning command, and G01 is a linear interpolation command.

**2. Common G-code Commands:**

- **G00/G01:** Rapid positioning/Linear interpolation.
- **G02/G03:** Circular interpolation (clockwise/counter clockwise).
- **G20/G21:** Set units to inches/millimetres.
- **G90/G91:** Set to absolute/incremental positioning.
- **M03/M05:** Start/stop spindle rotation.
- **M08/M09:** Coolant on/off.

**3. Axis Codes:**

- G-code commands often include axis codes to specify which axis is being referred to.
- X, Y, Z are common for three-axis machines.
- A, B, C are used for rotational axes.

**4. Parameters:**

- Parameters follow G-codes and provide specific details.
- For example, in G01 X1.0 Y2.0, X1.0 and Y2.0 are parameters indicating the destination coordinates.

**5. Comments:**

- Comments start with a semicolon (;) and are ignored by the machine. They are useful for adding human-readable notes to the code.

**6. Programming Workflow:**

- G-code is typically generated by CAM software based on a 3D model.
- The generated G-code is then transferred to the CNC machine's controller.
- The machine reads and executes the instructions, producing the desired part.

**7. Safety Considerations:**

- Understanding the machine's capabilities and limitations is crucial to avoid errors or accidents.
- Machinists should be familiar with emergency stop commands (e.g., M00 or M01).

**8. Customization:**

- G-code can be customized for specific applications or machines.
- Macro programming (using M98 and M99) allows the inclusion of subprograms.

**9. Simulation and Verification:**

- Before running G-code on a physical machine, it's often simulated to catch errors and ensure correct toolpaths.

**10. Post-Processing:**

- Post-processors convert CAM-generated toolpaths into machine-specific G-code.

**11. 3D Printing:**

- G-code is widely used in 3D printing to control the movement of the print head and bed, as well as extrusion parameters.

**Example G-code snippet:**

G00 X0 Y0 Z0           	; Rapid move to starting point

G01 X1 Y1 Z0 F10      	; Linear move to point (1, 1, 0) at a feed rate of 10 units/minute

M03 S1000               	; Start spindle at 1000 RPM

G02 X2 Y2 I1 J0        	; Clockwise circular move to point (2, 2) with a centre at (1, 0)

M05                    	; Stop spindle

It's important to note that specific G-codes and their meanings can vary between different CNC machines and controllers. Users should refer to their machine's documentation for accurate information.
